In short #
The ELO Dogfight server offers you to carry out 1 against 1 gun fights, with the plane of your choice, H24, 7/7. The matches are played in 3 points (possible results: 3-0 or 2-1). All match results are saved on the server, and an &amp;ldquo;ELO&amp;rdquo; is calculated for each pilot, per aircraft used, based on the result of each match.</description></item><item><title>Rules</title><link>https://elodogfight.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/regles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:49:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://elodogfight.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/regles/</guid><description>Some rules to be respected by any participant in ELO Dogfight.
Fighter Spirit
Whatever the circumstances, we stay cool and we have fun! The throwing of the glove is allowed, but must remain in a chivalrous and good-natured spirit. Exchanges on this server must remain limited to gun fights. For any philosophical, political, ethical debate, please find yourself on another media.

How do I know if the first merge happened? #
This point can be tricky, especially for newcomers. We recommend ensuring a crossing as close as possible.
Failing that, when you see that the two planes have started to turn around having made more than 90° of course change&amp;hellip; it means that the merge has passed!</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://elodogfight.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 19:25:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://elodogfight.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/contact/</guid><description>This site is created and administered by Frédéric "CoubyStark" Coubard.
